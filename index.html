  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a recent BSc (Hons) graduate from the University of Plymouth, where I
    was awarded the prestigious International Excellence Scholarship throughout my
    undergraduate studies. I have a strong foundation in GIS and Remote
    Sensing and I am passionate about combining geospatial technology with
    AI and machine learning to support better disaster management.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests include weather and environmental prediction, risk mapping
    and developing data-driven solutions for real-world challenges. From a
    young age, I dreamed of being Wonder Woman and helping others; today that
    passion motivates me to use technology to improve community resilience and
    public safety.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have developed solid technical experience as a GIS Developer with skills
    in digitizing, georeferencing, map design and cartography, raster
    processing, raster calculator, model builder and Python automation for
    geospatial workflows. I have also independently taught myself Python and
    machine learning techniques to deepen my analytical capabilities. 
  </p>
    
   <p>
    I am currently beginning winter training in Remote Sensing and AI-powered
    GIS at the Indian Space Academy, followed by an internship project there.
    This opportunity will allow me to strengthen my technical experience and
    apply what I’ve learned to real-world geospatial applications.
  </p>


  <p>
    Beyond academics, I enjoy contributing to community service through
    volunteering. In my free time, I like photography, binge-watching Netflix,
    and traveling to explore new places and cultures.

    <h2>NDVI Analysis Study</h2>

    <p>
    In this study, I calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 
    the Trivandrum region to understand vegetation health over time.
    Satellite imagery from Landsat-8/9 (2015 and 2025) was downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer
    dated 2015 and 2025.
    To streamline the workflow, model builder was used to automate the processing steps.
    The red (Band 4) and near-infrared (Band 5) layers were first clipped to the study area
    and NDVI was computed using the formula:
                                 NDVI = (B5 - B4)/ (B5 + B4)
    The results show that vegetation health has improved significantly over the last 10 years, 
    possibly due to reduced human activity during the COVID-19 period or regional conservation policies
    put forth by the government.
