  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a recent BSc (Hons) graduate from the University of Plymouth, where I
    was awarded the prestigious International Excellence Scholarship throughout my
    undergraduate studies. I have a strong foundation in GIS and Remote
    Sensing and I am passionate about combining geospatial technology with
    AI and machine learning to support better disaster management.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests include weather and environmental prediction, risk mapping
    and developing data-driven solutions for real-world challenges. From a
    young age, I dreamed of being Wonder Woman and helping others; today that
    passion motivates me to use technology to improve community resilience and
    public safety.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have developed solid technical experience as a GIS Developer with skills
    in digitizing, georeferencing, map design and cartography, raster
    processing, raster calculator, model builder and Python automation for
    geospatial workflows. I have also independently taught myself Python and
    machine learning techniques to deepen my analytical capabilities. 
  </p>
    
   <p>
    I am currently beginning winter training in Remote Sensing and AI-powered
    GIS at the Indian Space Academy, followed by an internship project there.
    This opportunity will allow me to strengthen my technical experience and
    apply what I’ve learned to real-world geospatial applications.
  </p>


  <p>
    Beyond academics, I enjoy contributing to community service through
    volunteering. In my free time, I like photography, binge-watching Netflix,
    and traveling to explore new places and cultures.
