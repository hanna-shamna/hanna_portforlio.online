  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am a recent BSc (Hons) graduate from the University of Plymouth, where I
      was awarded the prestigious International Excellence Scholarship throughout my
      undergraduate studies. I have a strong foundation in GIS and Remote
      Sensing and I am passionate about combining geospatial technology with
      AI and machine learning to support better disaster management.
    </p>

    <p>
      My interests include weather and environmental prediction, risk mapping
      and developing data-driven solutions for real-world challenges. From a
      young age, I dreamed of being Wonder Woman and helping others; today that
      passion motivates me to use technology to improve community resilience and
      public safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have developed solid technical experience as a GIS Developer with skills
      in digitizing, georeferencing, map design and cartography, raster
      processing, raster calculator, model builder and Python automation for
      geospatial workflows. I have also independently taught myself Python and
      machine learning techniques to deepen my analytical capabilities.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I am currently beginning winter training in Remote Sensing and AI-powered
      GIS at the Indian Space Academy, followed by an internship project there.
      This opportunity will allow me to strengthen my technical experience and
      apply what I’ve learned to real-world geospatial applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond academics, I enjoy contributing to community service through
      volunteering. In my free time, I like photography, binge-watching Netflix,
      and traveling to explore new places and cultures.

            <p>
              In this study, I calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 
              the Trivandrum region to understand vegetation health over time.
              Satellite imagery from Landsat-8/9 (2015 and 2025) was downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer.
              To streamline the workflow, model builder was used to automate the processing steps.
              The red (Band 4) and near-infrared (Band 5) layers were first clipped to the study area
              and NDVI was computed using the formula:
              NDVI = (B5 − B4) / (B5 + B4)
              Results show significant improvement in vegetation over 10 years.
